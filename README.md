# AutoContain - Automated-containerized-bioinformatics-workflows
![License](LICENSE)
## Summary
AutoContain is a web-based application for generating Dockerfiles and Docker images for scientific applications. Container technologies provide a valuable resource for bioinformaticians and data analysts within the scientific community. By bundling and packaging a complete toolchain or workflow, a container can provide portability, automation, and reproducibility.

This web application is meant for scientists who want a reproducible Docker image for their scientific projects and applications, but who do not have much experience in writing Dockerfiles or have trouble managing the dependencies that their project may rely on. The user-friendly web based GUI guides a user through all the steps to generate an appropriate Docker image.

* Generation of raw Dockerfile 
* User-friendly instructions for using Docker images
* Easy deployment instructions for the AutContain application

## Future-Development
* Support for multiple programming languages and package managers
* Support for third-party tools and binaries
* Automated deployment of Jupyter Notebook environment
* GUI based pipeline generation and management
* Container based scalability through third-party tools
* Other deployment options (eg. desktop application)

The application will allow users to select various components of a Docker image including a base Docker image, programming language packages and dependencies, operating system applications, imported data, and volume mapping.
